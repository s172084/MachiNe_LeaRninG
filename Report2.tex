\textbf{Explain what is predicted based on which other variables, and

a feature transformation to your data matrix X, such that each column

This project uses the Diamonds Dataset from The Grammar of Graphics
(\textbf{ggplot2}) package, which is part of the TidyVerse package. The
Diamonds Dataset contains the Prices and other attributes of over 50,000
round cut diamonds. The package was created by Hadley Wickham and other
data scientists to be used with the statistical programming language
called R .

Multiple Linear Regression is performed in order to predict the Price of
a Diamond based on the other attributes. In this section, the subgroup
of diamonds under analysis come from the \textbf{Premium Group} in the
colour category \textbf{D}. This subgroup of diamonds have a varied
clarity.

The continuous attributes such as the carat, the table, the length, the
width and the depth of a diamond are used to estimate the price of the
diamond. The \textbf{``SLM Calculate a prediction''} function takes new
observation of a diamond that is 142 mg in weight and predicts that the
price of that diamond is £2,909 or approximately DKK 24,830 .

In terms of feature transformations, the price of a diamond is converted
from United States Dollars (\$) to Danish Kroner (DKK) , (€) Euro and
(£) Pound Sterling. The categorical discrete attributes of diamond
colour, diamond clarity and diamond cut have either been removed or one
hot encoded for linear regression. This is due to issues with
multicollinearity of the dummy variables.

The measurements of diamond length, width and depth were converted from
millimetres (mm) to micrometers (µm). Carat was converted to milligrams
(mg) and the outliers, the, values that lie outside of the upper
boundary and lower boundaries, were removed.

In the dataset there are diamonds with a length, width or depth of 0.0 .
The smallest measured depth is 1,070 µm and exactly two diamonds have a
width of 3,730 µm. The ``determine outliers'' function was used to
estimate the upper and lower limits to be able to deal with outliers. It
was important to deal with outliers, by removing them, due to the fact
that these measurements may distort the statistical linear model.

\textbf{Introduce a lambda regularisation parameter from the lecture

The lambda regularisation parameter was introduced into the ridge
regularisation general linear model. A lambda regularisation parameter
manages the trade off between the bias and the variance. K = 10 Cross
Validation was used to find the optimal lambda. The graph shows a drop
in the Mean Squared Error and then a steady increase. Lambda controls
the amount of regularisation that is applied to the model.(see figure 1

\section{CLASSIFICATION}\label{classification}}

\hypertarget{question-1-1}{%
\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1-1}}

\begin{cols}

\begin{col}{0.45\textwidth}
Regarding the classification problem, we want to train a model which
labels whether a diamond has an \emph{Ideal cut} or not. This aim
appears to be feasible according to the projection of data onto the
space defined by the first three Principal Components (top figure of
page 11 of Report 1). Figure !1 represents a sample of diamonds
projected into the space defined by the second and third Principal
Component. It can be seen that by colouring data according to their
\emph{cut}, they appear to be clustered, especially the \emph{Ideal}
ones. So we aim to find a model which classifies diamonds in two binary
classes: \emph{Ideal} and \emph{Non-Ideal} cut, according to their
depth, table, price in DKK, carat in milligrams, length, width and depth
in micrometers. We choose to use only continuous attributes and to
ignore information coming from the color and clarity of diamonds.

\end{col}

\begin{col}{0.05\textwidth}

\begin{col}{0.50\textwidth}
\includegraphics{Images/PCA_cut.png} {Figure !1: Sample of diamonds
projected onto the space defined by the \(2^{nd}\) and \(3^{rd}\)
Principal component}

\end{col}

\end{cols}

~

The dataset seems to be almost balanced in the distribution of diamonds
between the \emph{Ideal Cut} and the \emph{Non-Ideal Cut}: the number of
\emph{Ideal} diamonds is about 21000 (corresponding to the 40 \% of the
dataset) whereas \emph{Non-Ideal} diamonds are about 32000 (60 \% of the
dataset). This means that there is no need to re-sample the dataset
since the predictors have enough observations of both the possible
outcomes.

\hypertarget{question-2-3}{%
\subsection{Question 2 \& 3}\label{question-2-3}}

Different models can be trained to classify diamonds in \emph{Ideal} and
\emph{Non-Ideal} cut. The simplest one is the Baseline (BL), based only
on the vector \textbf{y} of the outputs. In our case it is represented
by the attribute \emph{cut} transformed as follow: \[ y =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if cut = "Ideal"} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \] By computing the average of \textbf{y}, we obtain the
value of 0.4 (as we found in Question 1). According to this information,
the BL model always predicts a new diamond as \emph{Non-Ideal},
regardless its characteristics (depth, table, etc\ldots), with a
classification error of 40\%.

The other three models we want to analyse are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the Logistic Regression based on a linear combination of the
  attributes (LRL)
\item
  the Classification Tree (CT)
\item
  the Logistic Regression based on a quadratic combination of the first
  four Principal Components of the dataset (LRQ)
\end{itemize}

The choice of training a forth model is made because a quadratic
combination of the 7 considered attributes is very hard to be trained
(26 new columns representing the quadratic model would be added to the
dataset, resulting in an \textbf{X} matrix of 33 columns): the
computational time is too high and the process does not converge to a
solution. So, by reducing the dimensions of the problem thanks to the
Principal Component Analysis, we can consider a quadratic combination of
the first four Principal Components (the \textbf{X} matrix turns out to
have only 14 columns).

Each of the three above models requires a complexity parameter managing
the regularization of the model. Higher values of the complexity
parameter mean that large weights are penalized and data are less
important in the training of the model. On the other hand, lower values
of the complexity parameters allow the model to better follow data but
to be less general in case of new data.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Logistic regression models (LRL and LRQ) are regularized by the
  \(\lambda\) parameter, for which we do not know the value. Its value
  can be chosen by training the same model on the same data but with
  different values of \(\lambda\). As the dataset consists of 53879
  diamonds after the cleaning from the outliers, only four values of
  \(lambda\) have been tempted in the training of the LRL and LRQ
  models. The tempted values are:
  \(\lambda=\{10^{-5},10^{-4},10^{-3},10^{-2}\}\) (the choice of
  considering so low values is discussed later). We will choose the
  \(\lambda\) associated to the lowest generalization error computed on
  a dataset of diamonds independent from the one used to train the
  model.
\item
  Classification Tree is regularized by the \(c_P\) parameter (note that
  \(c_P\in[0,1]\)). \(c_P\) close to zero means more complex decision
  trees and more importance of data, \(c_P\) close to 1 means easier
  decision trees and less importance to data. The selection of the best
  value of \(c_P\) is the same of the Logistic Regression. The tempted
  values are: \(c_P=\{0.05,0.01,0.005,0.001\}\). In addition, CT is
  dependent on two more parameters, that are the minimum number of data
  to create a new node (question) and the minimum number of data to
  create a leaf. The choice have been arbitrary made by taking them
  respectively equal to 100 and 1.
\end{itemize}

The large number of observations leads to choose a ``light''
cross-validation method, that is the K-fold partition of the dataset
with a small number of folds. In particular, we choose four outer
partitions and six inner folds. This means that each model will be
trained: \[
\text{Nr. of trainings} = 4 \text{ outer folds } \cdot 6 \text{ inner folds } \cdot 4 \text{ complexity parameters } + 4 \text{ re-trainings } = 100 \text{ times}
\] Models are trained on the training datasets selected following the
cross-validation procedure and tested on independent datasets which have
not used to train the models. Given that we choose four outer partition,
we obtain four different results per each model and we choose the model
parameter associated with the lowest error rate computed as: \[
E_i^{test} [\%] = \frac{\text{Number of mis-classified data}}{\text{Total number of test data}} \cdot 100 \%
\]

Results of the two-level cross-validation are summarized in the Table
!2, where in bold are highlighted the lowest error rates per each model
and the associated best parameters.

\end{center}

As we expected, Baseline error rate is about 40 \% per each fold: it
varies because the dataset is splitted randomly in the four outer
partitions, so each outer fold does not contain the same amount of
\emph{Ideal} and \emph{Non-Ideal} diamonds.

Regarding the Logistic Regressions (both linear and quadratic), they
consist of solving a linear regression and then applying a sigmoid
function in order to project data in the range {[}0,1{]}. The linear
regression can be solved by the means of the regularized Least
Squares\footnote{Aster, Richard C. (2013). Parameter estimation and
  inverse problems. -- 2nd ed., Elsevier Inc., 94-95}, minimizing both
the data misfit and the model norm:

\[
min(||X_{train}w-y_{train}||^2_2+\lambda||w||^2_2)
\] Where \emph{w} is the model vector containing estimated weights of
the linear regression. Weights \emph{w} are estimated as follow: \[
w=(X_{train}^T X_{train}+\lambda I)^{-1}X_{train}y_{train}
\] By increasing \(\lambda\), more importance is given to the model
(linear model for the LRL, quadratic model for the LRQ) as the first
term of the above equations becomes negligible with respect to the
second one. On the other hand, by decreasing \(\lambda\) more importance
is given to observations (second term negligible with respect to the
first one). The regularization parameter \(\lambda\) allows to use
complex models even in case of small datasets without overfitting the
model because it constrains the observations to better follow the model.
But in our case, the dataset is very large and the model is very poor
with respect to the whole variability of data (it consists in a
hyper-plane for the LRL and in a hyper-paraboloid for the LRQ in the
multi-dimensional space defined by the attributes) and it does not
manage to precisely explain the behavior of the \emph{Cut} of diamonds
based on the other attributes. We are somehow facing with a problem of
underfitting, which cannot be solved because more complex models would
have too many parameters to be estimated. This is the reason why we
choose to consider only small values of \(\lambda\) and Table !2
confirms that the smallest values of \(\lambda\) are the ones giving the
smallest error rates.

Table !3 shows the estimated weights of the Logistic Regression based on
the linear combination of the attributes (LRL). It can be noticed that
the highest weights are associated to the \emph{Table} and to the
\emph{x dimension} of the diamonds, meaning that the LRL model bases its
predictions of the \emph{Cut} mostly on these two variables.

Table !4 shows the estimated weights of the Logistic Regression based on
the quadratic combination of the first four Principal Components (LRQ).
Figure !5 represents how each of the Principal Components depends on the
seven attributes. Looking at the weights of the Table !4, it can be
noticed that the second and third principal components are the most
weighted ones, both in their linear and quadratic form. These Principal
Components are mostly determined by the \emph{Depth} and \emph{Table} of
diamonds (green and cyan bars of Figure !5). The result agrees with the
Figure !1, showing the almost clear clusters wherein data projected onto
the space defined by the second and third Principal Components fall.

\begin{cols}

\begin{col}{0.60\textwidth}
As for the Classification Tree, once again the best complexity
parameters \(c_P\) are the smallest ones, meaning that trees with less
branches predict better the \emph{Cut} than more developed trees. The
Classification Tree associated with the lowest error rate is plotted in
Figure !6. As the figure shows, the classification of the diamonds in
\emph{Ideal} or \emph{Non-Ideal Cut} is based only on the \emph{Table}
and \emph{Depth} of them, regardless all the other attributes. According
to Table !2, even though the tree is so simple, it better classifies
diamonds than the Logistic Regressions, which requires the knowledge of
more variables to achieve a worse result.

\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}}

\begin{cols}

\begin{col}{0.50\textwidth}

In order to get a quantification of model performance which takes
uncertainty into account, we perform a statistical evaluation of the
four models pairwise. To do so, we choose to use McNemar test on the
difference of performance between two models. Results from this test are
valid only for conclusion about our diamond dataset and cannot be
generalized to other diamond datasets. McNemar test estimates the
difference in accuracy of model A and model B computing the statistic
\(\hat{\theta}\) as follows: \[
\hat{\theta}=\frac{n_{12}-n_{21}}{N}
\] Where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(n_{12}\): Nr. of times A predicts correctly and B wrongly
\item
  \(n_{21}\): Nr. of times B predicts correctly and A wrongly
\item
  \(N\): Size of the sample
\end{itemize}

\end{col}

\begin{col}{0.05\textwidth}
~

\end{col}

\begin{col}{0.45\textwidth}
\includegraphics{Images/McNemar.png} {Figure !7: Confidence intervals of
the difference in accuracy of models}

\end{col}

\end{cols}

So, according to the last definition, for a specific sample, if
\(\hat{\theta} > 0\) model A has predicted more observations correctly
than model B and vice versa. We apply the LRL model of Table !3, the LRQ
model of Table !4 and the CT model of Figure !5 to the whole dataset of
diamonds and we compare prediction vectors pairwise based on the vector
of the true outcomes. By setting a significance level of 5 \%, we
compute the confidence intervals of each difference in accuracy between
models, shown in Figure !7. All the confidence intervals results to be
negative, meaning that in all pairs of models, the second one has a
better performance than the first one. Looking at the first three
intervals on the left, we see that the three models (LRL, LRQ, CT)
perform much better than the baseline (BL). The Logistic Regression
based on the linear combination of the attributes (LRL) predicts worse
than the Logistic Regression based on the quadratic combination of the
Principal Components (LRQ) and the Classification Tree (CT). The
furthest to the right interval tells that the LRQ and the CT are the
most similar models, since their difference in performance is very close
to zero. However, the CT seems to perform better than the LRQ and,
considering that it requires only two attributes (\emph{Table} and
\emph{Depth}) for the prediction, it should be the recommended model to
be used, according to the analysis carried out in this report. If we
compute the \emph{p-values} of the \(\hat{\theta}\)s, we get numbers
smaller than the zero-machine. This means that there is a very strong
evidence from data that no model is identical to the others. The almost
zero values come from a division for the size of the sample, that in our
case is more than 53000.

\hypertarget{question-5}{%
\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}}

Now we want to explain how the Logistic Regression model (LRL) makes a
prediction. Assume that we want to determine whether the new diamond of
Table !8 has an \emph{Ideal Cut} or not. We firstly standardize the new
diamond according to standardization parameters of Table !9, coming from
the sample of the cross-validation which gave the best generalization
error. Here is an example of how we standardize \emph{Depth}, getting
the standardized diamond of Table !0: \[
\text{Standardized Depth}=\frac{\text{Depth}-\mu_{Depth}}{\sigma_{Depth}}=\frac{61.5-61.7}{1.43}=-0.17

~ Now we apply the logistic function to the linear combination of the
weights of the model of Table \#\# multiplied to the attributes of the
new standardized diamond of Table \#, so that we map the output of the
linear model in the interval {[}0,1{]}: \[
\text{Ideal Cut}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-0.84-0.84\cdot(-0.17)-2.23\cdot(-1.09)+0.60\cdot(-0.90)-0.83\cdot(-1.20)-1.24\cdot(-1.58)+0.82\cdot(-1.57)+0.56\cdot(-1.60)}}=0.88
\] Being the value 0.88 greater than 0.5, we classify the new diamond as
having an \emph{Ideal Cut}.

\textbf{Question 1}

The answer

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Question 2}

Answer \textbf{D}: we have a dataset of \(N=135\) elements, divided in 4
classes as follows:

37-31-33-34 (R)

By considering a tree made of two branches based on the value of
\(x_7\), we obtain the two following sub-groups:

\(x_7=2\) 0-1-0-0 (A) with \(N_2=1\)

\(x_7 \neq 2\) 37-30-33-34 (B) with \(N_2=134\)

By computing the \emph{classification error impurity measure} for each
branch, we obtain:

\(I_R=1-37/135=0.726\); \(I_A=1-1=0\); \(I_B=1-37/134=0.724\)

And finally we can calculate the purity gain based on the rule
\(x_7=2\):

\(\Delta_2=0.726-\frac{134}{135}\cdot 0.724=0.0074\)

\textbf{Question 3}

The answer

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Question 4}

Answer \textbf{D}: we concentrate on the class 4 and we notice that it
is the only one dependent only on \(b_1\) (Fig. 4). We see from Fig. 3
that rules A and C lead to class 4, so those rules must regard
conditions on \(b_1\). By looking at the four possible answers, only
answer \textbf{D} shows both A and C rules regarding \(b_1\).
