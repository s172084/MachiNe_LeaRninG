\hypertarget{question-1}{%
\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}}

\textbf{Feature Transformation} Here, the price is converted from United
States Dollars (\$) to Danish Kroner (DKK) , Euro and Pound Sterling
(Â£). The length , width and depth was converted from millimetres (mm) to
micrometers (um). In addition to this, carat was converted to milligrams
(mg). The original columns for carat, length, width and depth were
removed.

\textbf{Outliers} The outliers are any values that lie above the upper
boundary or below the lower boundary. There are 20 diamonds with the
value of depth listed at 0 in the dataset. The smallest depth is 1,070
micrometers. Two diamonds have a width of 3,730 micrometers and 7
diamonds have the width listed as 0. There are also 8 diamonds that have
a length of 0 in the dataset. It is important to deal with outliers
because they may distort the statistical linear model.

\textbf{Regression} The regression problem looks at the analysis of
attributes in order to predict the price of a diamond. In the multiple
linear regression analysis, the carat, the table, the length , the width
and the depth of a diamond are used to estimate the price of the
diamond.

\hypertarget{question-2}{%
\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}}

The output variable ( y ) is the price of a diamond. The output variable
is based on the linear model and also on the input variables
(attributes) inside of the Matrix ( X ). The input variables are also
called predictors.

The effect of each of the attributes on the Price is determined by the
coefficients that are associated with each of the attributes in the
linear model. The coefficients are the estimates for each independent
attribute term in the linear model. Th coefficients indicate how much
the Price is changes for a 1 unit change in the attribute. In order to
compute the Price of the diamond, the following equation can be used:

\[Price (Y) = b_{0} + ( b_{1} * depth)  + (b_{2} * table ) + (b_{3} * carat )  + (b_{4} * length ) + (b_{5} * width ) + (b_{6} * depth )\]

The coefficients say how much each attribute contributes to the
prediction of the Price. The positive coefficients indicate a positive
relationship. For example, as the carat increases the Price increases.
The negative coefficients indicate a negative relationship. For example,
as the width increases the Price decreases.

\begin{cols}

\begin{col}{0.45\textwidth}
Regarding the classification problem, we want to train a model which
labels whether a diamond has an \emph{Ideal cut} or not. This aim
appears to be feasible according to the projection of data onto the
space defined by the first three Principal Components (top figure of
page 11 of Report 1). Figure \# represents a sample of diamonds
projected into the space defined by the second and third Principal
Component. It can be seen that by coloring data according to their
\emph{cut}, they appear to be clustered, especially the \emph{Ideal}
ones. So we aim to find a model which classifies diamonds in two binary
classes: \emph{Ideal} and \emph{Non-Ideal} cut, according to their
depth, table, price in DKK, carat in milligrams, length, width and depth
in micrometers. We choose to use only continuous attributes and to
ignore information coming from the color and clarity of diamonds.

\includegraphics{Images/PCA_cut.png} {Figure \#: Sample of diamonds

Principal component}

\end{col}

\end{cols}

~

The dataset seems to be almost balanced in the distribution of diamonds
between the \emph{Ideal Cut} and the \emph{Non-Ideal Cut}: the number of
\emph{Ideal} diamonds is about 21000 (corresponding to the 40 \% of the
dataset) whereas \emph{Non-Ideal} diamonds are about 32000 (60 \% of the
dataset). This means that there is no need to re-sample the dataset
since the predictors have enough observations of both the possible
outcomes.

\hypertarget{question-2-3}{%
\subsection{Question 2 \& 3}\label{question-2-3}}

Different models can be trained to classify diamonds in \emph{Ideal} and
\emph{Non-Ideal} cut. The simplest one is the Baseline (BL), based only
on the vector \textbf{y} of the outputs. In our case it is represented
by the attribute \emph{cut} transformed as follow: \[ y =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if cut = "Ideal"} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \] By computing the average of \textbf{y}, we obtain the
value of 0.4 (as we found in Question 1). According to this information,
the BL model always predicts a new diamond as \emph{Non-Ideal},
regardless its characteristics (depth, table, etc\ldots), with a
classification error of 40\%.

The other three models we want to analyse are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the Logistic Regression based on a linear combination of the
  attributes (LRL)
\item
  the Classification Tree (CT)
\item
  the Logistic Regression based on a quadratic combination of the first
  four Principal Components of the dataset (LRQ)
\end{itemize}

The choice of training a forth model is made because a quadratic
combination of the 7 considered attributes is very hard to be trained
(26 new columns representing the quadratic model would be added to the
dataset, resulting in an \textbf{X} matrix of 33 columns): the
computational time is too high and the process does not converge to a
solution. So, by reducing the dimensions of the problem thanks to the
Principal Component Analysis, we can consider a quadratic combination of
the first four Principal Components (the \textbf{X} matrix turns out to
have only 14 columns).

Each of the three above models requires a complexity parameter managing
the regularization of the model. Higher values of the complexity
parameter mean that large weights are penalized and data are less
important in the training of the model. On the other hand, lower values
of the complexity parameters allow the model to better follow data but
to be less general in case of new data.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Logistic regression models (LRL and LRQ) are regularized by the
  \(\lambda\) parameter, for which we do not know the value. Its value
  can be chosen by training the same model on the same data but with
  different values of \(\lambda\). As the dataset consists of 53879
  diamonds after the cleaning from the outliers, only four values of
  \(lambda\) have been tempted in the training of the LRL and LRQ
  models. The tempted values are:
  \(\lambda=\{10^{-5},10^{-4},10^{-3},10^{-2}\}\) (the choice of
  considering so low values is discussed later). We will choose the
  \(\lambda\) associated to the lowest generalization error computed on
  a dataset of diamonds independent from the one used to train the
  model.
\item
  Classification Tree is regularized by the \(c_P\) parameter (note that
  \(c_P\in[0,1]\)). \(c_P\) close to zero means more complex decision
  trees and more importance of data, \(c_P\) close to 1 means easier
  decision trees and less importance to data. The selection of the best
  value of \(c_P\) is the same of the Logistic Regression. The tempted
  values are: \(c_P=\{0.05,0.01,0.005,0.001\}\). In addition, DT is
  dependent on two more parameters, that are the minimum number of data
  to create a new node (question) and the minimum number of data to
  create a leaf. The choice have been arbitrary made by taking them
  respectively equal to 100 and 1.
\end{itemize}

The large number of observations leads to choose a ``light''
cross-validation method, that is the K-fold partition of the dataset
with a small number of folds. In particular, we choose four outer
partitions and six inner folds. This means that each model will be
trained: \[
\text{Nr. of trainings} = 4 \text{ outer folds } \cdot 6 \text{ inner folds } \cdot 4 \text{ complexity parameters } + 4 \text{ re-trainings } = 100 \text{ times}
\] Models are trained on the training datasets selected following the
cross-validation procedure and tested on independent datasets which have
not used to train the models. Given that we choose four outer partition,
we obtain four different results per each model and we choose the model
parameter associated with the lowest error rate computed as: \[
E_i^{test} [\%] = \frac{\text{Number of mis-classified data}}{\text{Total number of test data}} \cdot 100 \%
\]

Results of the two-level cross-validation are summarized in the Table
\#, where in bold are highlighted the lowest error rates per each model
and the associated best parameters.

\[
\text{Table : Results of the two-level cross-validation used to compare models}
\] As we expected, Baseline error rate is about 40 \% per each fold: it
varies because the dataset is splitted randomly in the four outer
partitions, so each outer fold does not contain the same amount of
\emph{Ideal} and \emph{Non-Ideal} diamonds.

Regarding the Logistic Regressions (both linear and quadratic), they
consist of solving a linear regression and then applying a sigmoid
function in order to project data in the range {[}0,1{]}. The linear
regression can be solved by the means of the regularized Least
Squares\footnote{Aster, Richard C. (2013). Parameter estimation and
  inverse problems. -- 2nd ed., Elsevier Inc., 94-95}, minimizing both
the data misfit and the model norm:

\[
min(||X_{train}w-y_{train}||^2_2+\lambda||w||^2_2)
\] Where \emph{w} is the model vector containing estimated weights of
the linear regression. Weights \emph{w} are estimated as follow: \[
w=(X_{train}^T X_{train}+\lambda I)^{-1}X_{train}y_{train}
\] By increasing \(\lambda\), more importance is given to the model
(linear model for the LRL, quadratic model for the LRQ) as the first
term of the above equations becomes negligible with respect to the
second one, whereas by decreasing \(\lambda\) more importance is given
to observations (second term negligible with respect to the first one).
The regularization parameter \(\lambda\) allows to use complex models
even in case of small datasets without overfitting the model because it
constrains the observations to better follow the model. But in our case,
the dataset is very large and the model is very poor with respect to the
whole variability of data (it consists in a hyper-plane for the LRL and
in a hyper-paraboloid for the LRQ in the multi-dimensional space defined
by the attributes) and it does not manage to precisely explain the
behavior of the \emph{Cut} of diamonds based on the other attributes. We
are somehow facing with a problem of underfitting, which cannot be
solved because more complex models would have too many parameters to be
estimated. This the reason why we choose to consider only small values
of \(\lambda\) and Table \# confirms that the smallest values of
\(\lambda\) are the ones giving the smallest error rates.

\begin{cols}

\begin{col}{0.70\textwidth}
As for the Classification Tree, once again the best complexity
parameters \(c_P\) are the smallest ones, meaning that trees with less
branches predict better the \emph{Cut} than more developed trees. The
Classification Tree associated with the lowest error rate is plotted in
Figure \#. As the figure shows, the classification od the diamonds in
\emph{Ideal} or \emph{Non-Ideal Cut} is based only on the \emph{Table}
and \emph{Depth} of them, regardless all the other attributes. According
to Table \#, even though the tree is so simple, it better classifies
diamonds than the Logistic Regressions, which requires the knowledge of
more variables to achieve a worse result.

\textbf{Question 1}

The answer

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Question 2}

Answer \textbf{D}: we have a dataset of \(N=135\) elements, divided in 4
classes as follows:

37-31-33-34 (R)

By considering a tree made of two branches based on the value of
\(x_7\), we obtain the two following sub-groups:

\(x_7=2\) 0-1-0-0 (A) with \(N_2=1\)

\(x_7 \neq 2\) 37-30-33-34 (B) with \(N_2=134\)

By computing the \emph{classification error impurity measure} for each
branch, we obtain:

\(I_R=1-37/135=0.726\); \(I_A=1-1=0\); \(I_B=1-37/134=0.724\)

And finally we can calculate the purity gain based on the rule
\(x_7=2\):

\(\Delta_2=0.726-\frac{134}{135}\cdot 0.724=0.0074\)

\textbf{Question 4}

Answer \textbf{D}: we concentrate on the class 4 and we notice that it
is the only one dependent only on \(b_1\) (Fig. 4). We see from Fig. 3
that rules A and C lead to class 4, so those rules must regard
conditions on \(b_1\). By looking at the four possible answers, only
answer \textbf{D} shows both A and C rules regarding \(b_1\).
